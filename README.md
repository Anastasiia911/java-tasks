# Tasks:

## Task 1:
Consider the code in [task1](src/main/java/com/example/tasks/task1) package.  
It breaks the design principle [Open to extension, closed to modification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle).

**Create a new design that does not violate this principle and allows for the addition of any arbitrary weapon type in the future.**
